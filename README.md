# Simple_Calculator
A simple calculator Android app is a basic application that emulates the functionality of a physical calculator on a mobile device. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app features a user-friendly interface with a number pad, handles user input, performs calculations accurately, and displays the results dynamically. It incorporates error handling to prevent unexpected behavior and can include additional features like memory functions or percentage calculations. Development typically involves using Java or Kotlin, Android Studio or other IDEs, and thorough testing to ensure functionality and a seamless user experience.
